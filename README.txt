Getting Started

Table Builder is an API that allows users to dynamically create tables of any size
as well as add data to the table in either text or a link. Users are also able to undo
their previous delete and under their entire logged in session. Addtionally only one
user is allowed to be logged in at a time and the user will automatically be logged out 
after 5 minutes of inactivity. Finally a log is kept in a table of all changes, who the
 user was and the date stamp.
